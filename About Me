My name is Brooke Dietmeier and I am a student at the University of Washington. Go Dawgs! I'm majoring in Informatics with a focus on Cybersecurity and minoring in Business.
I first became interested in technology after taking AP computer science my junior year of high school. My high school computer science teacher is an extremely smart and kind, female computer scientist. 
She inspired me to believe in my academic capabilities no matter my gender and encouraged me to pursue an education in computer science and fields similiar to it. My interest in cybersecurity and the 
interworkings of technology is strongly influenced by my passion in criminal justice and my belief in the importance of protecting civil and human rights. I want to create a positive impact on the technology 
world by using my interpersonal and problem solving skills to aid in the facilitation of a hardworking and enjoyable work environment.   

Outside of school I like to spend time with my friends. Often times skiing, biking, playing volleyball or my newest hobby, scuba diving. When I 
was younger, my mom had to bribe me with candy to read. Now, I find myself eager to read and obtain as much information through books as possible. I love
crime novels almost as much as I love true crime television. When I'm not studying, reading or watching TV, I love to spend time with my family, 
playing board games and making dinners together. 

I pride myself on my ability to connect with others on a deeper level and networking with friends, family and acquaintances. I have played lacrosse and 
volleyball for the majority of my life, and I strongly believe that this has lead to a developed skill of communication and team work. Working with others
and problem solving has been a priority of mine for as long as I can remember and I believe that I employ these skills in almost every facet of my life. 
I am eager to expand my knowledge of how humans interact with technology and am excited to continue to learn and better my education in computer and data science.
